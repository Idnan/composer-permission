# Composer Permission

Composer script handling directories permissions

## Usage

Run the below command to install the plugin

```
composer require idnan/composer-permission:~1.0
```
And then put the below configuration in your composer.json file

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "Idnan\\ComposerPermission\\Handler::setPermissions"
        ]
    },
    "extra": {
		"dir_permissions": ["app/strorage:0777"]
    }
}
```

You can pass any permission as long as it is accepted by [chmod](http://php.net/manual/en/function.chmod.php).
